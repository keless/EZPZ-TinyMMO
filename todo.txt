WIP:

BUGS:
- server ticking game time about 2x faster than clients 
- client side fps is low, maybe because its not updating fast enough? see above 

TODO:
* optimize: do partial catch ups if an incremental update is missed by a client
* retroactively apply user inputs to server

* eventually: get cast engine working 
* eventually: figure out automatic NAT translation / sharing server invites
* eventually: plug-in content addition system
* eventually: template based random quest generation

Completed:
- FIXED: character names are not required to be unique
- ENG: refactor world update network code out of servergamecontroller into serverprotocol
* send incremental world updates
* un-delta world updates and use them
* send full world update to clients on connect
* generate and send world update deltas, next to full world updates (not using them yet)
* decouple world update broadcasts from game sim update ticks
- FIXED: deleting characters response client not updating list properly
- FIXED: graphics offset of players vs physics
* load data files (abilities, items, gfx/levels/tiledMap.json ) on server
* load tiledMap on server
* implement map physics on server
* no-sql no-setup database
* user registration
